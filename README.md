# WebScrapper
WebScrapper in 2020(watched nomad corders)

I did this in 2020, while watching python class of 'nomad corders'.

This program is scrap job information from website, and make it csv file.

* web site is korean and english , so in csv file(in this folder) korean part could be showing wrong text. 

This was tested on replit.
